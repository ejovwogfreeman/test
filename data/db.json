      "body": "Spider man is a marvel movie, we love spider man because he's amazing and can fly in a cool way using spider web. He's our favorite super hero. I've always wished to become a spider man right from the first day I watched the movie, and I wish I could save the world just like him. How amazing it would be, wearing my own suit and going places i've ever imagined. I would become the world's hero and a guardian angel to the city because everyone would need me. Spider Spider Spider all the way!\n",

I have also learnt a backend language and its frame work (python and its frmaework django). And i've build some simple front end projects with them.",
